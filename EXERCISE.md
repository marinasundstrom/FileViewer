### File viewer exercise

Your mission is to build a UI to visualise a file tree. It will work off an array of string paths, such as this:

```json
[
  "marvel/black_widow/bw.png",
  "marvel/drdoom/the-doctor.png",
  "fact_marvel_beats_dc.txt",
  "dc/aquaman/mmmmmomoa.png",
  "marvel/black_widow/why-the-widow-is-awesome.txt",
  "dc/aquaman/movie-review-collection.txt",
  "marvel/marvel_logo.png",
  "dc/character_list.txt"
]
```

You may visualize the data however you please, as long as the position of each file within the tree is evident. For a bare bones version it is ok to hard-code the files list.

Possible stretch tasks:

* ability to open/close folders
* make the UI support adding/editing/deleting files
* toggle between different visualisations
* unit tests (logic and/or UI components)

Bonus points for being generous with comments, as the whole point is to get a peek inside your architectural abilies!

Please provide us with both the means to try it out live (a link if a web app, or an executable if other platform), and a link to a repo with the source.
